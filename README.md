Students Depression Identification (Psychiatric System)

The Students Depression Identification (Psychiatric) System aims to identify students who may be experiencing depression due to the academic pressure of assignments. The system will be developed using face-api-js, TensorFlowJS, and the Mobilenet modal for identifying emotions. Here is a general outline of the system's components and how they will work together:

Front-end: The system will be built using Angular, which will provide a user interface for students to upload a picture of their face.

Face Detection: The face-api-js library will be used to detect faces in the uploaded images.

Emotion Detection: The TensorFlowJS library will be used to analyze the facial expressions and detect emotions in the detected faces.

Data Processing: The data collected from the emotion detection will be processed to determine if a student is experiencing symptoms of depression.

Notification: If a student is identified as potentially having depression, the system will notify the relevant faculty or staff members for further action.

Overall, the system will help identify students who may be struggling with depression and provide early intervention and support to help them succeed academically and personally.
